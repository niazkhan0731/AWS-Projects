This is my first attempt at launching an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console for the very first time and SSHing into it using the Bash Shell CLI on Linux. Here, I would like to document step by step how I accomplished it and the challenges I faced.

Using the CLI to control the EC2 instance offers several benefits:

- <b>Automation and Scripting:</b> The CLI allows for automation of repetitive tasks and the creation of scripts to streamline operations. It enables you to write scripts, perform batch operations, and automate the management of EC2 instances, enhancing efficiency and productivity.

- <b>Flexibility and Control:</b> The CLI provides fine-grained control over EC2 instance management. It offers a wide range of commands and options, enabling precise configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of instances. You can customize your commands to suit your specific requirements and have more control over your environment.

- <b>Remote Access</b>: With the CLI, you can remotely access and manage EC2 instances from anywhere using SSH. This allows for greater flexibility and convenience, as you can securely connect to your instances, execute commands, and troubleshoot issues without relying on a graphical user interface.

- <b>Integration with Other Tools:</b> The CLI seamlessly integrates with other tools, such as scripting languages, automation frameworks, and third-party applications. This enables you to incorporate EC2 instance management into your existing workflows and integrate it with your preferred development or deployment pipeline.

- <b>Efficiency and Speed:</b> The CLI often provides faster and more efficient management compared to the graphical user interface. It allows for quick execution of commands, retrieval of information, and configuration changes, making it ideal for situations that demand speed and agility.

By leveraging the power of the CLI, I not only gained a deeper understanding of EC2 instance management but also experienced firsthand the advantages it offers in terms of automation, control, remote access, integration, and overall operational efficiency.
